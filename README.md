# My solutions for [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems

## Created by: [Leonardo Dias](https://github.com/LeoDias-2020)

<br><br>This notebook has the intention to improve my habilities in coding (specially with Python and C) by solving mathematicals problems from Project Euler.<br>
Each one of the problems was solved in a separeted script .py or .c. <br>
These answers may not be the better ones: I tried to find my own solutions rather than stabilish in a efficient form.<br><br><br><br><br>
